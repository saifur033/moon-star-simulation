# moon-star-simulation
A simulation project involving Moon, Star, and a whisperer with semaphores and threads.
## Features
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes the `pthread` library to create concurrent threads for the Moon, Star, and Whisperer.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures safe interaction between threads using semaphores and mutex locks.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Simulates realistic interactions with random delays and user-defined steps.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Adds randomness with potential disruption alerts generated by the Whisperer.

## How It Works
1. The Moon and Star alternate between awake and asleep states.
2. The Whisperer monitors their states and logs:
   - When one or both are asleep.
   - Alerts about potential disruptions (random events).
3. The simulation runs for a user-defined number of steps.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saifur033/moon-star-simulation.git
## Navigate to the project directory:
cd moon-star-simulation
## Compile the program:
gcc -o moon_star_simulation simulation.c -lpthread
## Run the executable
./moon_star_simulation
## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- Libraries: pthread, semaphore.h
- Operating System: Linux or any Unix-like system (required for pthread support)
## Future Enhancements
Add more celestial objects (e.g., Sun, Planet) with unique interactions.
Create a GUI or graphical simulation to visualize the interactions.
Optimize synchronization for larger, more complex scenarios.
